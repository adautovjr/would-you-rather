This is an Udacity's React Developer course project submission where I used React and Redux together for the first time to create an app where you can impersonate a user to face and create dilemmas by answering hard questions with two options each. 

## Requirements

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, in order to install depedencies you can run:

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
